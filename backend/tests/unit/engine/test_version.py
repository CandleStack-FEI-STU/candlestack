# and 2 bps of slippage, trade the same story: a long flipped to a short, a long stopped out on
# its low, a short that gaps out at the open, two more flips, a long closed by the signal on a
# candle that opens beyond its stop, a short stopped out on its high and a change on the last
# row. With next_open the order closes that long at the open (rule 2), the short's stop is on
# its entry candle, where only a touch counts (rule 4), and the last change is never filled, so
# the long ends at the last close; signal_close closes it on the last row.
